- Background color: Very light teal (#198ABF) providing a calm, unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Pale brown (#FFFFFF) to highlight interactive elements.
- Font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif font for information and menu. Use this for both headings and body.
- Maintain a blocky and compartmentalized look and feel, similar to the one depicted in the picture. This would allow a clearer reading in the main page.
- Use flat, minimalist icons with a rounded style to represent different sections like Agenda, Events, etc.
- Subtle transition animations between sections. Slight zoom on elements to give the interface a more life
